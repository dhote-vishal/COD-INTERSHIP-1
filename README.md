## Overview of the Project

### Project: DIGITAL LOGIC DESIGN WITH VERILOG

### Objective

The objective of this task is to design basic digital logic circuits, including logic gates, adders, and multiplexers, using Verilog within a VLSI design environment. The task involves developing Verilog code for these circuits, simulating their behavior to verify correct functionality, and utilizing a waveform viewer to analyze and interpret the simulation results. The goal is to ensure that the designed circuits operate as intended, with accurate logic and timing, while gaining proficiency in digital logic design using Verilog.

### Key Activities

-**Design Digital Logic Circuits**: Develop Verilog code to implement basic digital logic circuits such as logic gates, adders, and multiplexers.

-**Simulate Designs**: Use simulation tools within the VLSI software to verify the functionality of the Verilog designs, ensuring they perform as intended.

-**Analyze Simulation Results**: Utilize the waveform viewer to examine the simulation results, checking signal behavior and timing to validate the correctness of the circuits.

-**Debug and Refine Designs**: Identify and troubleshoot any issues or discrepancies found during simulation, making necessary adjustments to the Verilog code.

### Technology Used

-**Verilog**: Hardware description language used for designing and modeling digital logic circuits.

-**VLSI Design Software**: Tools such as Cadence, Synopsys, or Xilinx for developing, simulating, and testing Verilog designs.

-**Simulation Tools**: Software like ModelSim, Vivado, or Synopsys VCS used to simulate the Verilog designs and verify their functionality.

4. *Waveform Analysis*:
   - Using waveform viewers to analyze simulation results, helping to verify the correctness of signal behavior and timing in the digital circuits.
   

### Procedure

Step 1 : After login into Amazon AWS, Visit the EC2 instance 


Step 2 : Then we will directed to the another webpage, then we will click here to launch instance, then we will proceed to next step 
where, we will fill all required info about Name, AMI etc, we will have the new instance live after few seconds.


Step 3 : Then we will click in Required Instance, then click on connect for further proceed. As we click, we will have console.



Step 4 : In console, we will run various cmd for updation, upload github wepage link, uploading webpages file.



Step 5 : Then, by Selecting the instance , gone to Security Groups & in inbound rules, we will change it to https & https, for public accessible all over the internet.



Step 6 : Then, we will seen that our webpage got live, while accessing through the public ip address
